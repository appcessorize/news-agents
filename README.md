# MENN AI powered personalized news

## ME News Network


### How does this work?

MENN is an AI-generated news report focused on updates from your friends and family, rather than world news or politics.
You can submit videos daily to the app. 

Your friends and family are invited to comment on these videos, and if they choose, they can be interviewed by our AI-powered journalist. 

At 8 PM every day, the AI compiles these submissions into a brief news report featuring your friends' videos and the local weather.

Here's what the 1st report from my friends and family looked like:

Please take a look it shows the project better than it can be described

### Why did you make this?

The news today can be quite divisive, and with the decline of local news. Social media at scale brings big benefits to a few individuals but negative externalities for society as a whole. I wanted to create something that focuses on hyper-local content. This app aims to foster community and shift away from the anger-inducing algorithms of widespread news platforms.

### X feature doesn't work. I spotted a bug...

I apologize for any inconvenience. This is an alpha release developed for a hackathon, and as such, there are known issues, such as the video analysis sometimes failing. Some other features might also be buggy. Please contact us if you encounter any significant bugs.

### What about the future?

Looking ahead, I plan to introduce new features such as local polls, events, and the opportunity for local businesses to include their own AI-generated advertisements during a brief ad break.
